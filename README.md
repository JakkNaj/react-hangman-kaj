## Description

The application is a pretty well-known game called Hangman. It is a word guessing game, where the player guesses letters and if the guess was right, if the correct letters are exposed, but if the guess was wrong, the part of hangman is uncovered and after 6 incorrect guesses the player loses and the word gets uncovered. There are some other features like playing under a certain "account" (name) and keep score in local storage, then the 3 highest local scores are shown to motivate other players to up their scores, but since it is saved only locally, the account part is based on "trust" system. The player can just type any name and log in as the following user. These features were added with aim to meet all requirements given in the course.
